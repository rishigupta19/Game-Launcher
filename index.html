        <h3 class="article-title">GRAND THEFT AUTO MAKER FIRMS UP GTA 6 RELEASE DATE</h3>
        <p class="article-description">One of the most eagerly anticipated video game releases of recent times the sixth edition of the Grand Theft Auto franchise will take place in autumn 2025, its publisher says. <span class="article-more">...<span></p>
          <p class="article-full" style="display: none;">Take-Two Interactive, parent company of developer Rockstar Games, made the announcement during its latest earnings call.
            
            Interest in GTA 6 is huge: the trailer for it has had more than 190m views on YouTube since it was released by Rockstar in December after being leaked online.
            
            Gaming industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told the BBC the long development time meant it was set to come to market "as the most expensive game ever made".
            
            "Rockstar is known for lengthy game development cycles as it strives to perfect its games before they are released but the wait for GTA 6 has been longer than ever," he said.
  
            He added the continued success of GTA 5 had eased pressure on Rockstar to rush out a less polished successor.
            
            Even though it has been more than 10 years since Rockstar released GTA 5, the game continues to be a key source of revenue for Take-Two.
            
            In its call with investors on Thursday, it disclosed it had sold 200 million units worldwide to date, with its audience size growing by 35% last year.
            
            That means it is still the second best selling video title of all time, behind Minecraft.
            
            But even though Take-Two may feel able to take its time, Mr Harding-Rolls suggested the release window for GTA 6 "will come as a bit of a blow to the console platform companies and games retailers looking to boost their sales" who may have been hoping it would arrive earlier in 2025.
            
            Earlier this month, Nintendo said it would make an announcement about a successor to its Switch console before March 2025.</p>

        <h3 class="article-title">GOD OF WAR RAGNAROK MIGHT BE NEXT PLAYSTATION EXCLUSIVE TO RELEASE ON PCE</h3>
        <p class="article-description">God of War Ragnarok is expected to be the next first-party PlayStation game that will be ported to PC. This highly acclaimed action-adventure game from Sony's Santa Monica Studio is expected to be officially announced possibly as early as this month.  <span class="article-more">...<span></p>
          <p class="article-full" style="display: none;">Sony has already expanded its exclusive lineup to include PC releases, with Horizon Forbidden West being made available earlier this year, and the PC port of Ghost of Tsushima set for May 16. Originally launched in 2022 for PS4 and PS5, God of War Ragnarok received a DLC in 2023.

            The details emerged from a reputable leaker named Billbil-kun, whose insights were shared in a report on Dealabs. According to the report, God of War Ragnarok's PC announcement is anticipated to happen in May 2024. Although specifics regarding the release date were not provided, the leaker indicated that the PC port is expected to arrive shortly.
            
            Moreover, the unveiling of God of War Ragnarok's PC release might occur during a PlayStation Showcase event, speculated to occur later this month. There are rumours circulating that Sony is planning a games showcase in May, with possibilities including a PlayStation Showcase or a State of Play presentation. However, Sony has not officially confirmed any plans regarding a PC port for God of War Ragnarok or announced dates for a showcase event.
            
            Sony has adhered to a strategy where its exclusive single-player titles are typically launched on PC after a year or more. Nixxes Software, a seasoned studio under Sony's umbrella, has been tasked with handling the PC ports of these titles. Nixxes, known for its work on PC ports of PlayStation's first-party games like Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, recently brought Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition to PC on March 21 and is preparing for the release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16.
            
            In a similar manner, God of War (2018) made its way to PC in 2022, following its initial launch on PS4 in 2018. The sequel, God of War Ragnarok, debuted on PS4 and PS5 in November 2022. Santa Monica Studio, the developers behind the series, subsequently released a free DLC expansion titled God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla in December 2023. This instalment continues the journey of Kratos, the titular god of war, and his son Atreus through the realms of Norse mythology.</p>

        <h3 class="article-title">MICROSOFT ANNOUNCES CUSTOMISABLE XBOX CONTROLLER FOR SPECIALLY-ABLED PEOPLE, PROTEUS: CHECK DETAILS</h3>
        <p class="article-description">Proteus is available for pre-order on the ByoWave website at a price of $255, with plans for it to be available for purchase later this year at $299, approximately Rs 25,000. <span class="article-more">...<span></p>
          <p class="article-full" style="display: none;">Microsoft recently introduced an innovative gaming controller aimed at enhancing accessibility for players with physical disabilities. This groundbreaking controller, named 'Proteus,' is part of the Designed for Xbox program and is developed by ByoWave. It features a unique 'snap and play' system, allowing users to create over 100 million configurations and customize LED lighting variations.

            Designed for one-hand operation, 'Proteus' consists of modular cubes that house essential gaming elements such as buttons, a directional pad, and analog sticks. Microsoft emphasizes the controller's versatility by highlighting its compatibility with a companion app, enabling users to easily remap buttons to suit their individual preferences and needs.
            
            Included in the 'Proteus' package are essential accessories like a USB-C charging cable, a Bluetooth dongle for wireless connectivity, two large one-button peripherals, and left and right handles, catering to different grip styles and comfort levels. This comprehensive controller kit aims to provide an inclusive gaming experience for all players, ensuring that everyone can enjoy their favourite games comfortably and efficiently.
            
            Proteus is set to be compatible with a range of Microsoft platforms, including the Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows 10, and Windows 11. However, it will not be compatible with consoles such as the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. Currently, Proteus is available for pre-order on the ByoWave website at a price of $255, with plans for it to be available for purchase later this year at $299, approximately Rs 25,000.
            
            In other news, Microsoft announced updates for the existing Xbox Adaptive Controller, initially launched in 2018 to assist players in creating adaptable gaming setups. An upcoming software update will enhance the controller's capabilities, allowing each USB port to support up to 12 buttons, a hat switch, and an additional switch.
            
            Moreover, Microsoft introduced a new filter feature that enables gamers to sort titles displayed in the 'My Games & Apps' section of their console based on accessibility and technical attributes, providing users with a more tailored gaming experience.</p>
